# Purpose

This repository contains the CI for AlmaLinux Atomic SIG images.

# Contributing

We welcome contributions to all parts of the AlmaLinux project. If you'd like to get involved, please feel free to reach out through [the chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigatomic)!

## Contributing - Code and Design

This project houses the Gitlab CI actions that will be used by other Atomic SIG projects to generate bootc images.

Before submitting code changes, please check if there are any open issues or pull requests that cover your proposal. If not, open an issue with a brief description and so you can discuss it with us first. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures proposed changes align with project goals. This can be your anticipated workflow:

- Create an issue describing your changes.
- Await confirmation from contributors.
- Fork the project.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Add your code, documentation, etc.
- Submit a pull request (PR). All PRs should target the `main` branch.

After review and approval, the changes will be merged and deployed.

## Reporting a Bug

If you find a bug, please report it [here](issues)!

## Requesting a Feature

We're open to feature requests! Please follow this workflow:

1. [Search existing issues](issues) to see if the feature has already been requested. If so, give it a thumbs up, +1, or a comment on your use-case.
2. If no similar request exists, open a new issue. Please clearly explain why the feature is needed and provide a detailed use case.

## Change Approval Process

- Minor or cosmetic changes (typos, small style tweaks) can be reviewed and approved by any contributor with merge rights.
- Larger changes should be agreed on as a SIG.
